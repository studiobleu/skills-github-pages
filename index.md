**🛡️ Privacy Policy for Interstice**

_Effective Date: May 28th, 2025_

Interstice is a Chrome extension that transforms the interface of TikTok’s web version to create a calmer, less addictive experience. This policy explains what data we access, how we use it, and your rights as a user.


**📌 What Interstice Does**
Interstice modifies the TikTok web interface by injecting custom CSS and JavaScript. These modifications:
- Remove or alter visually stimulating UI elements (e.g., like counters, autoplay, endless scroll)
- Simplify the interface to encourage more mindful interaction
- Require access only to content on tiktok.com, and never beyond that domain


**🔍 What Data We Access**
Interstice does **not** collect, log, store, or transmit any of your personal data. Specifically, we:
- Do not access or store any personal information (e.g. name, email, IP)
- Do not track user activity, such as clicks, mouse movement, or scrolling
- Do not collect or share browsing history
- Do not communicate with any external servers
The only access Interstice requests is to the website content of TikTok, which it uses to visually modify the interface on your own device, in real-time.


**🔐 Permissions Justification**
To deliver this functionality, Interstice uses the following Chrome extension permissions:
- host_permissions: https://www.tiktok.com/* – so it can access and restyle the TikTok page
- activeTab – to allow the extension to apply its modifications only when the user interacts with the TikTok tab
- scripting – to inject the UI-altering styles and logic into the page
These permissions are used strictly for the purpose of visual transformation and never for data extraction.


**🚫 Data Sharing & Third Parties**
We do not sell, rent, or share any data with third parties. Since Interstice does not collect or store data, there is nothing to share.


**✅ Your Consent**
By using Interstice, you acknowledge and agree that the extension functions entirely locally on your device, without transmitting data elsewhere.
